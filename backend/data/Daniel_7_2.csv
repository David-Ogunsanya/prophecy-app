"(Dan 7:3) And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.","Beast --> Kingdoms (See Dan 7:23)
Sea --> People (see Rev 17:15)",Daniel Saw Four great Kingdoms coming out of the people and each kingdom as different from each other.
"(Dan 7:4) The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.,","Lion --> Strong Nation, Fierce, Vicious, royalty (See Rev 5:5)
Eagle -->  Swiftness, defender, lifted up, great, exalted (See Job 9:26)
wings --> Destroying, healing, protection refuge (see Exodus 19:4, Deuteronomy 32:11, Malachi 4:2)
Earth --> land (see Gen 1:10, Dan 7:17)","In Daniel 7:4, the Babylonian empire is depicted as a lion with eagle's wings, symbolizing its powerful and swift dominance over surrounding nations. The lion, known for its strength and majesty, represents Babylon’s position as a formidable empire. The addition of eagle's wings highlights the speed with which Babylon extended its rule, rapidly conquering territories and establishing itself as a significant power. This imagery is reinforced by Habakkuk 1:6-8, which describes the Chaldeans (Babylonians) as a fierce and ""hasty nation,"" with soldiers moving as swiftly as eagles and fearlessly advancing like wolves.

However, Daniel also observes a transformation in the lion. He writes that the wings were “plucked,” signifying the end of Babylon's rapid expansion and the diminishing of its former strength. The empire, once lifted above obstacles by the eagle's wings, loses its momentum and becomes stagnant, no longer advancing its borders or wielding the same power. The prophecy continues by describing the lion standing on its feet like a man and receiving a man's heart, implying a shift from courage and strength to fear and weakness. This change is vividly seen in Belshazzar, Nebuchadnezzar’s successor, who was known for his lack of bravery. During a blasphemous feast, Belshazzar is so terrified by the appearance of supernatural writing on the wall that his knees knock together in fear, showing his cowardice (Daniel 5:6).

This transition illustrates how the once mighty Babylon, which had risen swiftly like an eagle, ultimately became vulnerable and fearful under weak leadership. It serves as a reminder of the divine judgment that befalls empires when they stray from righteousness, as even the strongest kingdom can be brought low when its leaders abandon their integrity and divine purpose."
"(Dan 7:5) And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.","Bear -> Government, violent (See Lam 3:10, 2 Sam 17:8)","In Daniel 7:5, the Medo-Persian Empire is symbolized by a bear that ""raised up itself on one side."" This image reflects the uneven power dynamic within the empire, as Persia eventually overshadowed Media. Initially, Media was the dominant power, with Persia as a supporting province. During the campaign against Babylon, Darius the Mede led the expedition, while his nephew Cyrus, a prince of Persia, acted as an ally. However, after Babylon’s fall and the death of Darius, Persia rose to prominence, gaining preeminence over Media. This shift in dominance was so pronounced that historians often refer to the combined empire simply as the ""Persian Empire,"" with Persia towering over its Median counterpart.

The bear is depicted with ""three ribs in its mouth,"" which are widely interpreted to represent the conquered provinces of Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt—territories that suffered under Medo-Persian rule. Each of these ""ribs"" signifies a major victory, fueling the empire’s ambitions for further expansion. The command given to the bear, ""Arise, devour much flesh,"" illustrates the aggressive drive that propelled this empire to conquer and subdue nations with little regard for human life.

Historically, the Medo-Persian Empire emerged when the Persians, initially a vassal state of Media, rose to prominence. Although Media was initially the dominant force, Persia soon took the lead, especially under the reign of Cyrus the Great. Cyrus’s conquest of Babylon in 538 B.C. marked the beginning of Medo-Persia's rule, and under his leadership, Persia’s dominance overshadowed the Median influence, making it the true powerhouse of the empire. This transition is symbolized by the bear ""raising itself on one side,"" reflecting Persia's preeminence over Media. This vast empire, known for its ruthless kings and their disregard for human life, became infamous for its despotic rule, which historian Prideaux describes as “the worst race of men that ever governed an empire” after the reign of Cyrus.

The Medo-Persian Empire's expansion continued until the battle of Arbela (or Gaugamela) in 331 B.C., when it was ultimately defeated by Alexander the Great. Throughout its 207-year reign, the empire’s actions were marked by an aggressive, relentless pursuit of power, often at the cost of those it conquered. This period saw extensive military campaigns that ground down opposing nations, robbing them of their autonomy and resources. The prophecy’s use of the bear as a symbol emphasizes the harsh, unyielding nature of Medo-Persian rule, presenting a stark contrast to the majesty of Babylon's lion and setting the stage for the fierce empires that would follow."
"(Dan 7:6) After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.","Leopard -> Government (See Jer 5:6, Hos 13:7)
Wings -> destroying, protection, refuge (See Exo 19:4, Deut 32:11)","The third kingdom, Greece, is represented in Daniel’s vision by a leopard with four wings and four heads, symbolizing the unparalleled speed and power of its conquests under Alexander the Great. The leopard itself, known for its swiftness, is further enhanced with four wings, indicating that Greece’s expansion was even more rapid than that of previous empires. Historically, this symbolism holds true, as Alexander’s campaigns stretched from Macedonia to the borders of India in just eight years, covering over 5,100 miles. This rapid expansion is unmatched in history and showcases the swift and unstoppable nature of Greece’s military strength.

The four heads of the leopard represent the division of the Grecian empire after Alexander’s death. When Alexander died suddenly in 323 B.C., he left no clear successor, leading his empire to be divided among his four leading generals. Cassander took control of Macedon and Greece in the west, Lysimachus ruled Thrace and parts of Asia Minor in the north, Ptolemy governed Egypt and surrounding territories in the south, and Seleucus held Syria and the eastern territories. This division into exactly four parts fulfilled the prophecy precisely, as foretold by the four heads of the leopard. Each general’s realm corresponded to one of the “heads,” demonstrating the accuracy of Daniel’s vision.

This division preserved the Grecian empire's influence for some time, though it was no longer a unified power. The prophecy’s specificity, down to the number of divisions within the empire, reflects the intricate detail with which these visions were fulfilled. The four-headed leopard accurately symbolizes the legacy of Greece, not only for its rapid expansion under Alexander but also for the fourfold division that came afterward, cementing the accuracy of the prophetic imagery."
"(Dan 7:7) After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.","Beast -> Kingdom (See Dan 7:23) 
Iron -> Strength, Heaven (See Deut 33:25)
Horns -> King/Kingdom (See Dan 7:24)","The fourth beast in Daniel’s vision is unlike any creature in nature, symbolizing a power that defies comparison with any earthly entity. Unlike other beasts, it is entirely nondescript, reflecting its unparalleled strength and diversity. This beast corresponds to the fourth division of Nebuchadnezzar’s image in Daniel 2, represented by the legs of iron, which symbolized Rome. The prophecy describes Rome as exceeding all others in strength and inspiring dread and terror. Historically, this is evident in its conquests, where Rome used its “iron teeth” to devour nations, crush them into submission, and leave them in utter ruin. No kingdom has matched its ability to dominate and reshape the ancient world.

The beast’s ten horns represent ten kingdoms that arose from the Roman Empire after its division. These ten kingdoms—identified as the Huns, Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Franks, Vandals, Suevi, Burgundians, Heruli, Anglo-Saxons, and Lombards—marked the fragmentation of Rome’s once-unified power. These divisions have been consistently regarded as the ten kingdoms of the Roman Empire, fulfilling the prophecy precisely. The horns underscore the enduring influence of Rome, not as a single entity but through the kingdoms that emerged from its collapse.

Rome’s legacy as the most dominant and destructive power of the ancient world aligns perfectly with the characteristics of the fourth beast in Daniel’s prophecy. Its diversity, unmatched strength, and significant historical influence are unparalleled, marking it as a unique empire in the prophetic timeline. The beast’s terrifying nature and the division into ten kingdoms highlight the precision and depth of the prophecy, which accurately captures the rise and fall of this unparalleled world power."
"(Dan 7:8) I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.",Horn -> King/Kingdom,"Daniel observed the horns closely and noticed an unusual development among them—a little horn emerged. Unlike the others, this horn did not quietly occupy its space; instead, it forcibly displaced three of the existing horns to establish its position. Historically, this little horn is identified as the papacy. The three horns it uprooted were the Heruli, the Ostrogoths, and the Vandals. These kingdoms were removed because they opposed the doctrines and authority of the papal system, particularly the supremacy of the bishop of Rome in the church. This action symbolized the papacy's rise to power by eliminating obstacles to its dominance.

The little horn is described as having “eyes like the eyes of a man” and “a mouth speaking great things.” The eyes symbolize the cunning, intelligence, and foresight of the papal system, which enabled it to navigate and manipulate political and religious landscapes to secure its power. The “mouth speaking great things” represents the bold and arrogant claims made by the papacy, such as its assertion of divine authority and supremacy over rulers and nations. This prophetic imagery perfectly encapsulates the papacy’s shrewdness and its ambitious, audacious claims throughout history.

The rise of the little horn serves as a profound fulfillment of prophecy, highlighting the unique nature of the papacy’s ascent to power. Unlike other kingdoms, its strength came not from military conquest alone but through strategic manipulation, religious authority, and the removal of opposition. The imagery of eyes and a speaking mouth emphasizes its unparalleled political and religious influence, shaping the course of history in accordance with the vision revealed to Daniel."
"(Dan 7:9)  I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. 
(Dan 7:10)  A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. 
(Dan 7:11)  I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. 
(Dan 7:12)  As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time. 
(Dan 7:13)  I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. 
(Dan 7:14)  And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. ","Ancient of Days -> Father
Son of man -> Jesus Christ
Book -> Record of judgments and remembrance (see Malachi 3:16)","The judgment scene described in Daniel presents a moment of profound significance and majesty. It begins with the establishment of thrones, symbolizing divine authority and the commencement of judgment by the great God Himself. The imagery of fire and flame, though a feeble representation, hints at the intense glory and holiness of God's presence. This sacred moment is further magnified by the presence of an innumerable host of angelic beings surrounding the throne, emphasizing the grandeur and solemnity of the event.

The second aspect of the scene focuses on the opening of the life records of humanity. These books, symbolic of the deeds and decisions of men, form the basis for the divine judgment. It is a moment of accountability, where each life is weighed and evaluated according to the eternal standards of righteousness. This process highlights the fairness and transparency of God's judgment, ensuring that all is done in accordance with His divine justice and mercy.

Finally, the Son of Man approaches the Ancient of Days, a depiction of Jesus coming before God the Father. He is accompanied by multitudes of angels, described here as the clouds of heaven. In this setting, Christ is given dominion, glory, and an everlasting kingdom. This scene does not depict the second coming of Christ to earth, as it occurs in the presence of the Ancient of Days, suggesting a heavenly event rather than an earthly one. It marks a pivotal moment in the divine plan, where Christ assumes His eternal reign over His redeemed kingdom."
"(Dan 7:15)  I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. 
(Dan 7:16)  I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. 
(Dan 7:17)  These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. 
(Dan 7:18)  But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.","Saint - > Holy of the Lord, Christians, protected from evil, faithful, patient, saved, nearest Him, His church, Inheritors, persecuted, called / sanctified, blessed, judges, loved, perfect, in His light, vessels of His glory, citizens of Heaven (See Phil 4:21, 1 Sam 2:9, Jude 1:3)
Most High -> Father ( See Mark 5:7)","Daniel experienced deep emotional distress as he reflected on the visions he had seen, feeling troubled in both his mind and spirit. Seeking clarity, he approached one of the heavenly beings present in the vision to understand its meaning. The being provided an explanation, revealing that the four great beasts represented four kings or kingdoms that would arise on the earth. These ""kings"" are not necessarily individual rulers but rather symbolic of the four great empires that would dominate history, acting as figureheads of their respective domains. Despite the rise of these earthly powers, Daniel was also assured that the saints of the Most High would ultimately inherit the eternal kingdom, emphasizing God's overarching plan for justice and restoration."
"(Dan 7:19) Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;","Fourth Beast -> Fourth Kingdom
Iron -> Strength
Brass - > Strength, from earth (Deut 33:25, Job 6:12, Job 40:18)","Daniel sought a deeper understanding of the fourth beast, which was unlike any other and uniquely terrifying. This beast symbolized Rome, known for its unparalleled system of governance and immense strength. Its iron teeth and brass nails highlighted its power and efficiency in conquest, reflecting Rome's ability to dominate and subjugate other nations. The description of the beast devouring, breaking into pieces, and stamping on what remained vividly illustrated Rome's strategy of conquering nations such as Britannia, Spain, and France and its systematic division of territories like Israel into administrative districts. The beast's actions of ""stamping the residue"" symbolized Rome's complete eradication of some nations, as seen in its destruction of Carthage and Jerusalem. This depiction emphasized Rome's ruthless nature and its unprecedented impact on history."
"(Dan 7:20) And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.","Look -> Appearance
Ten horns -> Ten Kingdoms
Stout -> Great, Lordly","The vision of the ten horns on the fourth beast represents ten kingdoms that arose from the Roman Empire after its decline. Among these horns, another smaller horn appeared, symbolizing the rise of the Papacy. Unlike the others, this new horn was aggressive and powerful, causing three of the original kingdoms (the Heruli, Ostrogoths, and Vandals) to fall entirely as the Papacy established its dominance.

This horn is described as having ""eyes,"" symbolizing intelligence, cunning, and ambition, and ""a mouth speaking great things,"" representing the bold and blasphemous claims of the papal authority during its rise to power. The phrase ""more stout than its fellows"" illustrates the papacy's elevated status and its prideful, commanding presence compared to the other kingdoms. Historical references, such as the 1302 papal decree Unam Sanctam, highlight the Papacy's assertion of absolute authority over all humanity, confirming the prophetic vision of its arrogance and dominance during this era. This passage serves as a reflection on the significant role of the Papacy in shaping history and fulfilling Daniel's prophecy"
"(Dan 7:21)  I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; 
(Dan 7:22)  Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. ","Horn -> Kingdom (Papacy)
Saints -> Christians","This passage delves into the actions of the ""little horn,"" which Daniel observed waging war against the saints and prevailing over them until divine intervention. Historically, the rise of the ten horns symbolizes the division of the Roman Empire into ten kingdoms between A.D. 351 and 476. Among these kingdoms, the ""little horn"" emerges, representing the Papacy—a spiritual kingdom distinct from the political nature of the other kingdoms. The prophecy aligns with history, as the Papacy's rise and its subsequent persecution of saints, including groups like the Waldenses, Albigenses, and Protestants, led to significant bloodshed. Historical records suggest that Papal persecutions resulted in more martyrdoms than any other religious or political power in history.

The passage highlights three significant events in the prophecy's timeline. First is ""the coming of the Ancient of Days,"" representing God taking His place in the judgment scene as described earlier in Daniel. This marks the commencement of divine judgment. Second is the judgment given to the saints, referring to their role in the millennial judgment after the first resurrection, where they assess the deeds of the wicked and assign their due punishments (Revelation 20:4). This is a moment of vindication for those persecuted during the Papacy's reign. Lastly, the saints' possession of the kingdom symbolizes their inheritance of the new earth, where sin and its consequences are completely eradicated, and they rule in righteousness forever (1 Corinthians 6:2-3; Matthew 25:34).

This interpretation portrays the ultimate triumph of God's people over sin and oppression. The saints' final reward—the everlasting kingdom—is presented as the culmination of God's plan, where justice and restoration replace persecution and suffering. This vision offers hope and assurance to believers, reinforcing the certainty of God's promises and the eventual establishment of His eternal kingdom."
"(Dan 7:23)  Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. 
(Dan 7:24)  And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. ","Fourth Beast -> Fourth Kingdom
Ten horns -> Ten Kingdoms","This passage focuses on the fourth beast, which represents the Roman Empire, and its subsequent division into ten smaller kingdoms. The angel in the prophecy identifies the fourth beast as the fourth kingdom on Earth, which is Rome, ruling from 168 B.C. to A.D. 476. The prophecy states that this beast will ""devour the whole earth, tread it down, and break it in pieces,"" symbolizing Rome’s vast conquests and its unique structure of governance and military might.

The ten horns of the beast symbolize the ten kingdoms into which the Roman Empire fragmented between A.D. 351 and 476. These kingdoms and their modern counterparts are listed as follows: Alemanni (Germany), Franks (France), Anglo-Saxons (England), Burgundians (Switzerland), Visigoths (Spain), Suevi (Portugal), Lombards (Italy), Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths. This division aligns with historical records and is widely agreed upon by scholars, including Protestant and Catholic commentators. References to renowned works such as Sir Isaac Newton’s Observations upon the Prophecies and other theological writings confirm the interpretation of this prophecy, showing consistent acknowledgment of the Roman Empire’s role in biblical prophecy.

Additionally, the ""little horn"" mentioned in the prophecy, which rises among the ten horns, is often interpreted as representing the Antichrist. The Catholic Douay Bible and other scholarly interpretations agree that this horn symbolizes a significant power that emerges after the fall of Rome, distinct from the ten political kingdoms. Historical and theological references highlight the precision and clarity of this prophecy, solidifying its interpretation as the rise and fall of Rome and the emergence of powers that shaped subsequent history."
"(Dan 7:25) And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.","Saints -> Christians
Time -> Year
Most High -> Father","Daniel 7:25 describes the actions and character of the ""little horn,"" widely interpreted as the papacy. The verse outlines key aspects of this power’s opposition to God and persecution of His people. The first part of the prophecy states that the little horn would ""speak great words against the Most High."" This has been historically linked to the papacy's bold claims, such as titles like “Lord God, the Pope” and “Vicegerent of the Son of God,” which attribute divine authority to the pope. The church has also claimed infallibility, the power to forgive sins, and the authority to open or shut heaven—roles traditionally reserved for God alone. The arrogance of such declarations is seen as a direct fulfillment of this prophecy, highlighting the blasphemous nature of the papal system.

The second aspect of the prophecy states that this power would ""wear out the saints of the Most High."" Historically, this refers to the relentless persecution carried out by the papacy over centuries, including the massacres of the Waldenses, Albigenses, and Protestants. The use of crusades, inquisitions, and executions led to the death of millions of faithful Christians. Scholars estimate that as many as 50 million people perished due to papal persecution. The church’s claim that it was not directly responsible for these acts but merely handed over heretics to the secular power is widely regarded as a hollow justification. History reveals that the secular authorities acted as tools of the church, carrying out its bloody commands.

The third aspect is the claim that the little horn would ""think to change times and laws."" This is often interpreted as the church’s attempt to alter divine law, most notably the Sabbath commandment, shifting worship from the seventh day (Saturday) to the first day (Sunday). The church's claim to wield both spiritual and temporal swords, using the material sword when the spiritual sword failed, demonstrates its intent to enforce its authority over both spiritual and secular matters. This prophecy, when compared with history, paints a vivid picture of the papacy's role in fulfilling Daniel 7:25, making it a key chapter in understanding the struggles between truth and power throughout history."
"(Dan 7:26)  But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. 
(Dan 7:27)  And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. ","Saints -> Christians
Most High -> Father","Daniel 7:26-27 brings the narrative to a pivotal conclusion, highlighting both the judgment of the oppressive little horn power and the eventual triumph of God’s kingdom. Verse 26 declares, ""The judgment shall sit,"" referring to the investigative judgment in heaven, which is believed to have commenced in 1844 at the close of the 2300-year prophecy described in Daniel 8:14. This judgment signifies a critical moment in which God’s authority is established over earthly powers. It marks the beginning of the end for the dominion of the papacy, which had previously ruled for 1260 years, culminating in its overthrow in 1798 when the pope was captured, fulfilling the prophecy of the ""deadly wound"" in Revelation 13:3. Although the papacy regained some temporal authority in 1800, its dominance was never fully restored, and by 1870, it lost its status as a temporal ruler.

In verse 27, the focus shifts to the ultimate reward for the saints. The verse declares that the ""kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven,"" will be given to the saints of the Most High. This kingdom is characterized as eternal and all-encompassing, where every dominion will serve and obey God. It offers a vision of hope and restoration, ensuring that the saints will inherit a kingdom free from oppression and misrule. This promise provides a source of strength and encouragement for believers throughout history, affirming that God’s justice will prevail and His kingdom will endure forever.

As the chapter concludes, Daniel reflects on the profound and troubling visions he has witnessed. While the oppressive reign of the little horn and the suffering of the saints weighed heavily on his heart, the assurance of God’s everlasting kingdom offered a glimmer of hope. For believers, this prophecy underscores the certainty of God's ultimate victory and the promise of eternal peace and righteousness, motivating them to remain steadfast in their faith as they anticipate the fulfillment of God’s kingdom."
"(Dan 7:28) Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.",,
